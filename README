# Instant compiler

This is my solution to the first assignment on the compilers course (MRJP) at
University of Warsaw.

Presented is a compiler of a toy language called Instant to LLVM and JVM
bytecodes.

## Compilation

stack build

Makefile is configured to do this, too.

## Running

stack exec compile llvm <file.ins> > out.ll
stack exec compile jvm <file.ins> > out.j

Convenience scripts ./insc_llvm and ./insc_jvm defined as in the task objective.

## Dependencies

The project heavily relies on stack (packaging toolÂ for Haskell). The additional
bash scripts ./insc_llvm and ./insc_jvm use jasmin, clang and sed.

The parsing code is generated using BNFC, but it is not necessary for
compilation or for running.
